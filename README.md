Welcome to my personal repo of self-tried proof of concepts on Java learning!

In this repo, I've compiled a collection of my attempts to master the art of Java programming.
Now, I'll admit that not everything in here is perfect. There may be some bugs, some things that don't quite work as expected, and some code that could definitely be optimized. But that's all part of the learning process, right?

So, if you're ready to dive in and learn more about Java, come on in and take a look around. Let's explore the wonderful world of Java together!
